# FUTURE_DS_03
## College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project (Task 3)

---

### Objective
To analyze student feedback collected after college events and uncover satisfaction trends using rating data and text-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help organizers improve future campus events.

---

### Dataset
The dataset contains student-level feedback collected after college events, including:
- Event name and type
- Department and year
- Overall rating (1–5 scale)
- Free-text feedback comments

This structure enables both quantitative analysis and sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- seaborn & matplotlib  
- TextBlob (Sentiment Analysis)

---

### Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Rating distribution analysis
- Event-type-wise performance comparison
- Sentiment analysis on textual feedback using TextBlob
- Visualization of satisfaction and sentiment trends
- Interpretation of results and recommendations

---

### Key Insights
- Workshops and technical seminars received the highest average ratings.
- The majority of feedback comments expressed positive sentiment, indicating overall satisfaction.
- Negative sentiments were primarily related to logistical issues such as audio quality, pacing, and scheduling.
- Sentiment trends closely aligned with numeric ratings, validating feedback consistency.

---

### Recommendations
- Increase the number of hands-on workshops and skill-based events.
- Improve event logistics including sound systems, seating, and time management.
- Incorporate more interactive elements to maintain engagement.
- Continuously analyze feedback to improve future events.
